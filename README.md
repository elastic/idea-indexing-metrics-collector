<!-- Plugin description end -->

This [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) plugin gives developer teams the chance to analyse how much time they spent on indexing their projects.
The plugin captures indexing events occurred in IDEA and pushes them into an [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch)  cluster for further analyzise. 

The captured data per indexing event includes

- project name
- total indexing time in ms
- indexing reason
- duration of file scanning in ms
- indexing duration in ms
- update start
- update end
- was full indexing (true / false)
- was indexing interrupted (true / false)
- platform info 
  - idea application name 
  - version 
  - build number
  - plugin version
- runtime info 
  - max available processors
  - idea java memory settings 
  - indexing thread count)
- environment info
  - user name (can be optionally anonymized)
  - host name (can be optionally anonymized)
  - os name
  - os arch
  - os version

The [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch)  mapping template can be found here: [elasticsearch index mapping](https://github.com/elastic/indexing-metrics-collector/blob/main/src/main/resources/idea-indexing-mapping.json)

The idea for this came up when I heard first time about [shared project index](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/shared-indexes.html#project-shared-indexes) for IntelliJ IDEA.
If you want to know the impact of such a plugin you need to have hard numbers first. In a distributed team gathering these numbers are tricky so the idea
for this plugin was born.

## Analyzing

The captured data allows gaining further insights why and how much time is spent on indexing in idea for your developers
This is an example [kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) dashboard used during development of this plugin
